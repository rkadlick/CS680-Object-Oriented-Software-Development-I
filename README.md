# CS680-Object-Oriented-Software-Development-I
This holds all of the work (assignments) from CS680 (Spring 2021)

---------

# HW1
- Implement Calculator and CalculatorTest
- Implement PrimeGenerator and PrimeGeneratorTest

# HW2
Create build script for Caculator and CalculatorTest

# HW3
Reimplement PrimeGenerator and PrimegeneratorTest (hw1) using Ant

# HW4
Complete Student class and test its static factory methods

# HW5
- Define Car class and implement getters
- Write CarTest
-- Include a private method carToStringArray()
-- Define a test method verifyCarEqualityWithMakeModel

# HW6
- Implement DVD example (note10) with State and Singleton
- Write test cases

# HW7
- Implement a File System in Java(note 13)
- Set up and run test cases using a test fixture

# HW8
Use file system from hw7
Add new elements "alias" and "links"
Add necessary tests

# HW9
The task for this assignment was again to build on our File System project from hw07 and hw08. We were now meant to include two different types of File Systems that each came with their own restrictions. This File Systems used the classes from hw08 as super classes. We also carried over the test fixture from the prior projects and edited as needed.
- Build on file system from hw7 and hw8
- Create two variations of a file system with new restrictions, using the prior file system as their super
- Create necessary tests

# HW10
The task in this assignment was to build on the File System project from hw09. In this version, we add 3 different Visitor classes that can all crawl through the file system and search for different things. We have a Counting Vistor, File Crawling Visitor, and a File Search Visitor that all work with Apfs file systems.
- Build on file system from hw09
- Create 3 different Visitor classes to crawl through file system
- Counting, File Crawling, File Search

# HW11
- Build on Car project from earlier in semester.
- Create 4 comparator classes to compare cars
- Test sorting functions of comparator classes

# HW12
The task for this assignment was to further revise the File System project from prior assignments. In this version we add three new comparator classes, that can compare and sort file system elements by name, date of creation, or date last modified. We also set up the file system to always have a default sort of alphabetical.
- Build on file system from hw10
- Create 3 new comparator classes
- Default sort file systems alphabetically

# HW13
- Create Observer and Multicast
-- Example of DJIA and Stock Events
- Observers track changes and Observables notify observers of a change

# HW14
The task was to edit the answer to hw11. We were to replace the Comparator classes we created with lambda functions.
- Build on hw11
- Replace Comparator classes with lambda functions

# HW15
The task for this assignment was to revise the answer to hw12, we were to replace the use of our created Comparator classes with lambda functions.
- Build on hw12
- Replace Comparator classes with lambda functions
